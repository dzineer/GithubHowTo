######################
Git on the commandline - Extended
######################

In this section you will:

*   install and configure Git locally
*   create your own local clone of a repository
*   create a new Git branch
*   edit a file and stage your changes
*   commit your changes
*   push your changes to GitHub
*   make a pull request
*   merge upstream changes into your fork
*   merge changes on GitHub into your local clone

So far we've done all our Git work using the GitHub website, but that's usually
not the most appropriate way to work.

You'll find that most of your Git-related operations can and need to be done on the commandline.

Install/set up Git
==================

::

    sudo apt-get install git # for Debian/Ubuntu users
    brew install git # for Mac OS X users with Homebrew installed

There are other ways of installing Git; you can even get a graphical Git application, that will include the commandline tools. These are described at:

    http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

Tell Git who you are
--------------------

First, you need to tell Git who you are::

    git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"

Give GitHub your public keys
----------------------------

This is a great timesaver: if GitHub has your public keys, you can do all
kinds of things from your commandline without needing to enter your GitHub
password.

*   https://github.com/settings/ssh

https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys explains much better than
I can how to generate a public key.

**This tutorial assumes you have now added your public key to your GitHub
account.** If you haven't, you'll have to use *https* instead, and translate
from the format of GitHub's *ssh* URLS.

For example, when you see::

    git@github.com:evildmp/afraid-to-commit.git

you will instead need to use::

    https://github.com/evildmp/afraid-to-commit.git

See https://gist.github.com/grawity/4392747 for a discussion of the different
protocols.


Some basic Git operations
=========================

When we worked on GitHub, the basic work cycle was *fork* > *edit* > *commit*
> *pull request* > *merge*. The same cycle, with a few differences, is what we
will work through on the commandline.

Clone a repository
------------------

When you made a copy of the *Don't be afraid to commit* repository on GitHub,
that was a *fork*. Getting a copy of a repository onto your local machine is
called *cloning*. Copy the *ssh URL* from
``https://github.com/<your github account>/afraid-to-commit``, then::

    git clone git@github.com:<your github account>/afraid-to-commit.git

Change into the newly-created ``afraid-to-commit`` directory, where you'll find
all the source code of the *Don't be afraid to commit* project.

Now you're in the **working directory**, the set of files that you currently
have in front of you, available to edit. We want to know its status::

    $ git status
    # On branch master
    nothing to commit (working directory clean)

Create a new branch
-------------------

Just as you did on GitHub, once again you're going to create a new branch,
based on *master*, for new work to go into::

    $ git checkout -b amend-my-name
    Switched to a new branch 'amend-my-name'

``git checkout`` is a command you'll use a lot, to switch between branches. The
``-b`` flag tells it to **create a new branch** at the same time. By default,
the new branch is based upon whatever branch you were on.

You can also choose what to base the new branch on. A quite common thing to do is, just for example::

    git checkout -b new-branch existing-branch

This creates a new branch ``new-branch``, based on ``existing-branch``.

Edit a file
-----------

#.  find the ``attendees_and_learners.rst`` file in your working directory
#.  after your name and email address, add your Github account name
#.  save the file

``git status`` is always useful::

    $ git status
    # On branch amend-my-name
    # Changes not staged for commit:
    #   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
    #
    #   modified:   attendees_and_learners.rst
    #
    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

What this is telling us:

*   we're on the *amend-my-name* branch
*   that we have one modified file
*   that there's nothing to commit

These changes will only be applied to this branch when they're committed. You
can ``git add`` changed files, but until you commit they won't belong to any
particular branch.

.. note::
   When to branch

    You didn't actually *need* to create your new *amend-my-name* branch until
    you decided to commit. But creating your new branches before you start
    making changes makes it less likely that you will forget later, and commit
    things to the wrong branch.

Stage your changes
------------------

Git has a **staging area**, for files that you want to commit. On GitHub
when you edit a file, you commit it as soon as you save it. On your
machine, you can edit a number of files and commit them altogether.

**Staging a file** in Git's terminology means adding it to the staging
area, in preparation for a commit.

Add your amended file to the staging area::

    git add attendees_and_learners.rst

and check the result::

    $ git status
    # On branch amend-my-name
    # Changes to be committed:
    #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
    #
    #   modified:   attendees_and_learners.rst
    #

If there are other files you want to change, you can add them when you're
ready; until you commit, they'll all be together in the staging area.

What gets staged?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's not your files, but the **changes to your files**, that are staged. Make
some further change to ``attendees_and_learners.rst``, and run ``git status``::

    $ git status
    # On branch amend-my-name
    # Changes to be committed:
    #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
    #
    #   modified:   attendees_and_learners.rst
    #
    # Changes not staged for commit:
    #   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
    #
    #   modified:   attendees_and_learners.rst
    #

Some of the changes in ``attendees_and_learners.rst`` will be committed, and the
more recent ones will not.

    * run ``git add`` on the file again to stage the newer changes

Commit your changes
-------------------

When you're happy with your files, and have added the changes you want to
commit to the staging area::

    git commit -m "added my github name"

The ``-m`` flag is for the message ("added my github name") on the commit -
every commit needs a commit message.

Push your changes to GitHub
---------------------------

When you made a change on GitHub, it not only saved the change and committed
the file at the same time, it also showed up right away in your GitHub
repository. Here there is an extra step: we need to **push** the files to
GitHub.

If you were pushing changes from *master* locally to *master* on GitHub, you
could just issue the command ``git push`` and let Git work out what needs to go
where.

It's always better to be explicit though. What's more, you have multiple
branches here, so you need to tell git *where* to push (i.e. back to the remote
repository you cloned from, on GitHub) and *what* exactly to push (your new
branch).

The repository you cloned from - yours - can be referred to as **origin**. The
new branch is called *amend-my-name*. So::

    $ git push origin amend-my-name
    Counting objects: 34, done.
    Delta compression using up to 2 threads.
    Compressing objects: 100% (21/21), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (28/28), 6.87 KiB, done.
    Total 28 (delta 13), reused 12 (delta 7)
    To git@github.com:evildmp/afraid-to-commit.git
     * [new branch]      amend-my-name -> amend-my-name

.. note::
   Be explicit!

    Next time you want to push committed changes in *amend-my-name*, you won't
    *need* to specify the branch - you can simply do ``git push``, because now
    *amend-my-name* exists at both ends. However, it's *still* a good idea to
    be explict. That way you'll be less likely to get a surprise you didn't
    want, when the wrong thing gets pushed.

Check your GitHub repository
----------------------------

*   go to https://github.com/<your GitHub name>/afraid-to-commit
*   check that your new *amend-my-name* branch is there
*   check that your latest change to ``attendees_and_learners.rst`` is in it


Send me a pull request
----------------------

You can make more changes locally, and continue committing them, and pushing
them to GitHub. When you've made all the changes that you'd like me to accept
though, it's time to send *me* a pull request.

**Important**: make sure that you send it from your new branch *amend-my-name*
(not from your *master*) the way you did before.

And if I like your changes, I'll merge them.

.. note::
   Keeping master 'clean'

    You *could* of course have merged your new branch into your *master*
    branch, and sent me a pull request from that. But, once again, it's a good
    policy to keep your *master* branch, on GitHub too, clean of changes you
    make, and only to pull things into it from upstream.

    In fact the same thing goes for other branches on my upstream that you
    want to work with. Keeping them clean isn't strictly necessary, but it's
    nice to know that you'll always be able to pull changes from upstream
    without having to tidy up merge conflicts.

Incorporate upstream changes
----------------------------

Once again, I may have merged other people's pull requests too. Assuming that
you want to keep up-to-date with my changes, you're going to want to merge
those into your GitHub fork as well as your local clone.

So:

* on GitHub, pull the upstream changes into your fork the way you did
  previously

Then switch back to your master branch in the usual way (``git checkout
master``). Now, fetch updated information from your GitHub fork (**origin**),
and merge the master::

    git fetch
    git merge origin/master

So now we have replicated the full cycle of work we described in the previous
module.

.. note::
   ``git pull``

    Note that here instead of ``git fetch`` followed by ``git merge``, you
    could have run ``git pull``. The ``pull`` operation does two things: it
    **fetches** updates from your GitHub fork (**origin**), and **merges**
    them.

    However, be warned that occasionally ``git pull`` won't always work in the
    way you expect, and doing things the explicit way helps make what you are
    doing clearer.

    ``git fetch`` followed by ``git merge`` is generally the safer option.


Switching between branches locally
----------------------------------

Show local branches::

    git branch

You can switch between local branches using ``git checkout``. To switch back to
the *master* branch::

    git checkout master

If you have a changed tracked file - a tracked file is one that Git is
managing - it will warn you that you can't switch branches without either
committing, abandoning or 'stashing' the changes:

Commit
^^^^^^

You already know how to commit changes.

Abandon
^^^^^^^

You can abandon changes in a couple of ways. The recommended one is::

    git checkout <file>

This checks out the previously-committed version of the file.

The one that is not recommended is::

    git checkout -f <branch>

The ``-f`` flag forces the branch to be checked out.

.. note::
   Forcing operations with ``-f``

    Using the ``-f`` flag for Git operations is to be avoided. It offers plenty
    of scope for mishap. If Git tells you about a problem and you force your
    way past it, you're inviting trouble. It's almost always better to find a
    different way around the problem than forcing it.

    ``git push -f`` in particular has ruined a nice day for many people.


Stash
^^^^^

If you're really interested, look up ``git stash``, but it's beyond the scope of this tutorial.
